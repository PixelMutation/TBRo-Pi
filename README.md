# TBRo-Pi
This repository contains the python programs which run locally on the Pi.  
These will handle:
- Communications (between Rover and Mission Control, and to Serial devices)
- High level control of motors and actuators
- Automation and Computer Vision
- Camera live streaming

Note that this version is configured for the Screw Tank vehicle, so needs adapting for other purposes
